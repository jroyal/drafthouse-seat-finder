# drafthouse-seat-finder

![seat finder logo](https://almightyzero.com/drafthouse/images/seat_finder_title.svg)

This project exists because I go to the alamo drafthouse way to much. I found myself getting mildly annoyed with having to click through multiple slow loading charts to figure out which showing I wanted to go to. To fix that problem I made this.

This site allows someone to choose the day and movie they want to see and quickly view all the seat charts for that film at that moment.

Hopefully you find it as useful as I do.
